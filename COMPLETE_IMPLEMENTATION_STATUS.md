## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:**

### **Frontend (Risebot - Port 3004)**
```
/risebot/components/sections/
├── NativeUglyDogGame.js     # Main game component (602 lines)
├── UglyDogGameSection.js    # Section wrapper  
└── /home-03/page.js         # Integration point
```

### **Backend (Node.js - Port 3005)**
```
/backend/
├── server.js               # Express server with MySQL
├── database_setup.sql      # Database schema
└── .env                   # Environment configuration
```

### **Game Logic Flow:**
```
1. Start Game → Clear timers → Initialize state
2. Move Dog → Generate traps → Start countdown timer
3. User Click → Clear timers → Show effect → Schedule next move
4. Auto-miss → Count miss → Schedule next move  
5. Level Up → Show notification → Increase difficulty
6. Game Over → Clear timers → Submit score → Show results
```

## 🎯 **GAME DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION:**

| Level | Score Range | Timer | Traps | Interval | Difficulty |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|------------|
| 1     | 0-29        | 6s     | 0     | 4s       | Beginner   |
| 2     | 30-59       | 6s     | 0     | 4s       | Easy       |
| 3     | 60-99       | 5s     | 1     | 3s       | Easy Plus  |
| 4     | 100-149     | 5s     | 1     | 3s       | Medium     |
| 5     | 150-199     | 4s     | 1     | 2.5s     | Medium+    |
| 6     | 200-299     | 4s     | 2     | 2.5s     | Challenging|
| 7     | 300-399     | 3s     | 2     | 2s       | Hard       |
| 8     | 400-549     | 3s     | 2     | 2s       | Very Hard  |
| 9     | 550-749     | 2.5s   | 3     | 1.5s     | Expert     |
| 10    | 750+        | 2.5s   | 3     | 1.5s     | Ultimate   |

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED:**

### 1. **Timer Management**
- ❌ **Before:** Multiple overlapping timers, memory leaks, infinite loops
- ✅ **After:** Single timer per dog, proper cleanup, efficient management

### 2. **Game Flow Logic**  
- ❌ **Before:** Dog moves immediately after click, confusing UX
- ✅ **After:** 800ms delay for user feedback, smooth transitions

### 3. **Trap Positioning**
- ❌ **Before:** Traps overlap with dog, poor positioning algorithm
- ✅ **After:** Smart overlap detection, 20px minimum distance

### 4. **Level Progression**
- ❌ **Before:** Inconsistent score jumps, unbalanced difficulty
- ✅ **After:** Smooth 30→30→40→50 point progression, balanced curve

### 5. **Visual Clarity**
- ❌ **Before:** Hard to distinguish real dog from traps
- ✅ **After:** Clear borders, colors, animations for each element type
